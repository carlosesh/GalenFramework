## Quick Intro to Maven

TestNG	is	a	testing	framework	inspired	from	JUnit	and	NUnit with	more	functionality	
added	to	make	execution	more	efficient	and	powerful. It	is	an	open	source	automated	
testing	framework.
TestNG	eliminates	most	of	the	limitations	of	the	older	framework	and	gives	the	
developer	the	ability	to	write	more	flexible	and	powerful	tests	with	help	of	easy	
annotations,	grouping,	sequencing	&	parameterizing.
Benefits	of	TestNG
Major	advantages	of	testing	are:
• Logs	can	be	generated
• Annotations make	code	efficient	and	easy	to	manage
• Ability	to	produce	HTML	Reports of	execution
• Test	cases	can	be	Grouped	&	Prioritized
• Parallel testing	is	possible
• Data	Parameterization is	possible
Annotations	in	TestNG
@BeforeSuite:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	before	all	tests	in	the	test	suite
@AfterSuite:	Method with	this	annotation will	run after all	tests	in	the	test	suite
@BeforeTest:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	before	each	and	every	test	method
with	<test>	tag	in	xml	file
@AfterTest:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	after	each	and	every	test	method
with	<test>	tag	in	xml	file
@BeforeClass:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	before	first	test	method	in	current	
class
@AfterClass:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	after	last	test	method	in	current	class
@BeforeMethod:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	before	each	test	method
@AfterMethod:	Method with	this	annotation will	run	after	each	test	method
@Test:	The	annotated	method	is	a	part	of	a	test	case.
Benefits	of	using	annotations
1. TestNG	identifies	the methods that it	is	interested	in	by	looking	up	annotations.	
Hence	method	names	are	not	restricted	to	any	pattern	or	format.
2. We	can	pass	additional	parameters	to	annotations.
3. Annotations	are	strongly	typed,	so	the	compiler	will	flag	any	mistakes	right	away.
4. Test	classes	no	longer	need	to	extend	anything	(such	as	Test	Case,	for	JUnit	3).
